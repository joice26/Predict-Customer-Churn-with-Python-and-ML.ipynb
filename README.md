# Churn Prediction

## Introduction
Churn prediction is probably one of the most important applications of data science in the commercial sector. The thing which makes it popular is that its effects are more tangible to comprehend and it plays a major factor in the overall profits earned by the business.
## What exactly is Churn Prediction?
Churn is defined in business terms as ‘when a client cancels a subscription to a service they have been using.’ A common example is people cancelling Spotify/Netflix subscriptions. So, Churn Prediction is essentially predicting which clients are most likely to cancel a subscription i.e ‘leave a company’ based on their usage of the service.

From a company point of view, it is necessary to gain this information because acquiring new customers is often arduous and costlier than retaining old ones. Hence, the insights gained from Churn Prediction helps them to focus more on the customers that are at a high risk of leaving.
The output in the case of Churn prediction is a simple yes or a no. That makes it a classification problem where you have to predict 1 if the customer is likely to churn and 0 otherwise.

## Why does Churn occur?

Many factors influence the reasons for a customer to Churn. It may be the fact that there’s a new competitor in the market offering better prices or maybe the service they are getting has not been up to the mark, so on and so forth.

Hence, there is no correct answer as to why exactly the customer wants to churn because as you can see there are many influencing factors.

A data scientist’s job is to find such patterns in the data given and see what facts are churned out during data analysis.
